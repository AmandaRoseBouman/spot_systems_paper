abstract = {This paper introduces ANYmal, a quadrupedal robot that features outstanding mobility and dynamic motion capability. Thanks to novel, compliant joint modules with integrated electronics, the 30 kg, 0.5m tall robotic dog is torque controllable and very robust against impulsive loads during running or jumping. The presented machine was designed with a focus on outdoor suitability, simple maintenance, and user-friendly handling to enable future operation in real world scenarios. Performance tests with the joint actuators indicated a torque control bandwidth of more than 70 Hz, high disturbance rejection capability, as well as impact robustness when moving with maximal velocity. It is demonstrated in a series of experiments that ANYmal can execute walking gaits, dynamically trot at moderate speed, and is able to perform special maneuvers to stand up or crawl very steep stairs. Detailed measurements unveil that even full-speed running requires less than 280W, resulting in an autonomy of more than 2 h.},

abstract = {In this work we present an integrated approach for autonomous navigation and mapping in underground mines using aerial robots. Underground mines present a set of critical challenges as they are not only GPS-denied by nature, but their environmental circumstances also lead to severe sensor degradation (due to combinations of darkness, dust, and smoke), localizability problems (due to textureless surfaces and locally self-similar structure), while also presenting stringent navigation conditions as a result of certain very narrow geometries. To address these issues, the presented robotic systems integrate a multi-modal sensing suite and a set of associated fusion algorithms that enable simultaneous localization and mapping in the GPS-denied and visually-degraded environment of underground mines. More specifically, the fusion of visual and thermal cameras, LiDAR, as well as Inertial Measurement Unit cues is investigated in order to provide informative data in textureless, dark, and obscurants-filled settings. Provided the capacity for reliable pose estimation and mapping the surroundings despite the sensing degradation, autonomous navigation then becomes possible. Model Predictive Control is used to enable precise trajectory tracking and robustness against disturbances. Path planning for collision-avoidance and autonomous exploration is facilitated through a receding horizon sampling-based algorithm that further accounts for the vehicle dynamic constraints and its limited endurance. The integrated system is tested in field experiments inside underground metal mines in Northern Nevada. The presented results correspond to the navigation and mapping of mine drifts and headings and involve environments that are completely dark, dust-filled, and particularly textureless. As shown, the proposed approach ensures the robust and reliable autonomous navigation of aerial robots in underground mines, alongside consistent mapping.},

Establishing reliable communication is a very difficult task for underground mining due to the extreme environmental conditions. Until now, no single communication system exists which can solve all of the problems and difficulties encountered in underground mine communications. However, combining research with previous experiences might help existing systems improve, if not completely solve all of the problems. In this survey, underground mine communication is investigated. Major issues which underground mine communication systems must take into account are discussed. Communication types, methods, and their significance are presented. {\textcopyright} 2005 IEEE.},

abstract = {The need for reliable maps of subterranean spaces too hazardous for humans to occupy has motivated the use of robotic technology as mapping tools. As such, we present a systemic approach to autonomous topological exploration of a mine environment to facilitate the process of mapping. This approach focuses upon the interaction of three high-level processes: topological planning, intersection identification and local navigation. Topological planning tasks the robot to investigate stretches of mine corridor for the purpose of collecting data. Intersection identification converts sensory input into topological components used to construct an online topological map and provide the robot with a global sense of position. Local navigation transforms topological exploration objectives into robot actuation enabling traversal of mine corridors. These processes are described in detail with results presented from experiments conducted at a research coal mine near Pittsburgh, PA. {\textcopyright}2005 IEEE.},

In view of the plurality of related applications such as planetary exploration, search and rescue, agriculture, mining and off-road exploration, the aim of the present survey is to review the field of 3D terrain traversability analysis that is employed at a preceding stage as a means to effectively and efficiently guide the task of motion planning. We identify that in the epicenter of all related methodologies, 3D terrain information is used which is acquired from LIDAR, stereo range data, color or other sensory data and occasionally combined with static or dynamic vehicle models expressing the interaction of the vehicle with the terrain. By taxonomizing the various directions that have been explored in terrain perception and analysis, this review takes a step toward agglomerating the dispersed contributions from individual domains by elaborating on a number of key similarities as well as differences, in order to stimulate research in addressing the open challenges and inspire future developments. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},
