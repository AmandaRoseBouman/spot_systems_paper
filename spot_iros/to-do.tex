\begin{enumerate}
  \item Go through the paper and check that 'autonomous spot' has been renamed to its abbreviation. I'm currently liking: Au-Spot (/awe-spot/).
  \item We tend to mention the DARPA Subterranean Challenge or SubT a lot. I like mentioning it over and over because this is a big deal in robotics but MAYBE sometimes it can get redundant. Double check its usage throughout the paper before the final submission.
  \item Make sure NASA's JPL/ NASA JPL /NASA whatever wording is corrected and maintained as consistent across the paper.
  \item NeBula is referenced a few times before the full explanation of what it is in Section II. Think about how to rectify this. 
  \item Fix the references section, it looks a bit screwed up.
  \item change "SubT" to "Subterranean". Doesn't look right to abbreviate one word in the title just because it's long. We should either have a short term for the whole "Urban Circuit of the DARPA Subterranean Challenge" or not abbreviate portions of it randomly.
